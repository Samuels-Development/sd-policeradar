# sd-policeradar

sd-policeradar is a feature-packed yet minimalist police radar that includes standard functionalities such as checking the speeds and license plates of vehicles both ahead and behind you. You can also lock the radar, save entries to a radar log for later retrieval, create BOLOs that highlight a license plate with a red background if it matches, set an auto radar lock, and more. The system features a convenient keybind menu displaying all available keybinds, along with the ability to freely move UI elements and save their positions using KVPâ€”ensuring your playersâ€™ layouts are retained across restarts and logouts.
